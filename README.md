In this project I have used MERN stack to build this task management website.
<h3>Home Page</h3>

<p>This is how our Home page looks like. Where all three kinds of tasks are visible and it is very easy to use, we just have to add new task by clicking on the "add button" present in each of the section.</p>

<p>We can also change the state of the task by using some options available like "To do", "Doing" & "Done" so that user can accordingly change tasks. There is two more options available
"Update" & "Delete" which helps user to update the title and description of that task, and delete is used to remove a task.</p>
